This repository contains a Python script (`List.py`) that demonstrates the fundamentals of **lists in Python**.  
It includes examples of creation, manipulation, operations, and built-in functions for lists.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- **Difference between lists and arrays**  
  - Lists are built-in and flexible (can store heterogeneous data).  
  - Arrays (from the `array` module) are faster but store only homogeneous data.  

- **Types of lists**  
  - 1D list  
  - 2D list (matrix)  
  - 3D list (nested structures)  

- **List operations**  
  - Indexing & slicing  
  - Updating elements  
  - Adding (append, extend, insert)  
  - Deleting (del, remove, pop, clear)  
  - Iteration (1D, 2D, 3D lists)  

- **Built-in functions with lists**  
  - `len()`, `min()`, `max()`, `sum()`, `sorted()`, `reversed()`, `index()`  
  - Sorting & reversing lists  

- **String manipulation with lists**  
  - Example: Capitalize the first letter of every word in a sentence
